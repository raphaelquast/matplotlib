Correctly treat pan/zoom events of overlapping Axes
---------------------------------------------------

The forwarding of pan/zoom events is now determined by the visibility of the
background-patch (e.g. ``ax.patch.get_visible()``) and by the ``zorder`` of the axes.

- Axes with a visible patch do not forward events to axes below.
  Only the Axes with the highest ``zorder`` that contains the event is triggered
  (if there are multiple Axes with the same ``zorder``, the last added Axes counts)
- Axes with an invisible patch forward events to axes at lower or equal ``zorder``

To override the default behavior and explicitly set whether an Axes
should capture navigation events, use `.Axes.set_capture_navigation_events`.
